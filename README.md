# get_psn_library

:warning: The database schema was modified throughout the project to adapt to what I could use from the API and the implementations I wanted to put in place to make the application useful for other users. New table to implements users (sign up form) and to save their token, new table to store games that do not yet have a release date. Ability to create a  partial CRUD for user's desired games (maybe an update incoming for a total crud)...





## Data Conceptual Model
### Management rules
* A user has an identifier, unique pseudo, a password, and a token
* **A user has at least 0 game and at most several games**
* A game has an identifier, a name, an image, a description, a release date, a started date for games, a last played game, a number of hours played and a way to get it.
* **A user has at least 0 wished game and at most several wished games**
* A wished game has an identifier, a title, a date expected, a description and a picture
